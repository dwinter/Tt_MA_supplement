#Supplimentary file for our Tetrahymena mutation rate paper

This repo holds an [Ipython Notebook](Suppliment.ipynb) containing an
exploratory analysis into an unsual pattern affecting two lines of our MA
experiment.

To limit the size of this repository, the _T. thermophila_ reference genome,
which is required to compile this notebook, is not included. It can be fetched
from ciliate.org via

```sh
wget http://www.ciliate.org/system/downloads/T_thermophila_June2014_assembly.fasta -O data/tt-ref.fasta
```
The notebook can then be opened and edited via a web-browser by running `ipython notebook`
